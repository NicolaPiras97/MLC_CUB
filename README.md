# Multilevel latent class for ordinal data with CUB models

This is the code we used for the simulations in the paper "Multilevel latent class with CUB models". The code in this version is available for simulation reproducibility purposes only and is an incomplete version of the code necessary to perform full analyses applying the Multilevel Latent Class analysis for ordinal data.

## Usage
To run the simulations launch the .R files, which recalls a C++ program. Be sure to have installed .R, and the R packages Rcpp, RcppEigen and
RcppArmadillo. The two versions of the estiamtion algorithm are available: Hierarchical_CUB and Cross-Classified_CUB.
